= XTDB Sakila Playground

XTDB playground for the https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/[Sakila] sample dataset.

== Getting started:

* To start a REPL, run `clj -M:xtdb:nrepl`, and then connect to it from your editor of choice.
* You'll then have a running XTDB node at `user/xt-node` - query it to your heart's content!

For more information, see the https://docs.xtdb.com[main XTDB docs].
